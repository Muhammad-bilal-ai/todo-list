Creating a todo list using react.js. I will Use tailwindcss for styling, Redux toolkit or (useReducer with useContext) for global state managment, data will not lost on refresh.User will be able to add, edit and delete todo items, mark items as completed, filter items based on completed and pending. I will use framer motion for animations.
